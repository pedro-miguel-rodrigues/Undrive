Undrive was develop as a project in the course User Centered Design, the goal was to tackle one of the four problems of OF URBAN TRANSPORTATION:
* Communication
  * Friction arise when users donâ€™t have the informationthey need when they need
* Emissions and Energy Efficiency
  * Transportation accounts for 25% of CO2 emissions in the EU and is the main cause of pollution in cities
* Labor and Safety
  * The cost of labor is the primary driver of operation costs for passenger transport
* Space
  * Transportation takes a vast amount of urban space

In the development of this project before we started with the Application we developed a Value Proposition and a Business Model Canvas shown in [Project Pitch and Stakeholders](https://github.com/pedro-miguel-rodrigues/Undrive/blob/main/Project%20Pitch%20and%20Stakeholders.ppsx)

After the [User Research Plan](https://github.com/pedro-miguel-rodrigues/Undrive/blob/main/User%20Research%20Plan.ppsx) we started working in the [Low Fidelity Prototype](https://github.com/pedro-miguel-rodrigues/Undrive/blob/main/Low%20Fidelity%20Prototype.ppsx)
